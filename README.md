Code for my thesis. Each folder corresponds to an example that I use in the paper. For each example: 

- 'Q-Learning Maze' uses q-learning to solve a basic maze environment. The hyperparameters are set in the file 'Q-Learning' and the code is run from that file as well.

- 'TicTacToe Naiive' has two q-learning bots play against each other. The hyperparameters are set in the file 'Q-Learning' and the code is run from 'test.py'.

- 'TicTacToe Minimax' implements Minimax Q_Learning from [L. BusÂ¸oniu, R. Babuska, and B. De Schutter](http://www.dcsc.tudelft.nl/~bdeschutter/pub/rep/10_003.pdf). The hyperparameters are set in the file 'Q-Learning' and the code is run from 'test.py'.
